## üéØ What This Does

This pipeline automatically:
1. **Fetches** 1,000 property records from Wake County NC public API
2. **Scrapes** 200-300 additional property details from Orange County NC assessor website
3. **Cleans** owner names and addresses (handles "SMITH, JOHN" vs "JOHN SMITH")
4. **Deduplicates** using exact + fuzzy matching algorithms
5. **Merges** data from both sources by matching parcel IDs
6. **Scores** each record's quality (0-100 based on completeness)
7. **Exports** formatted Excel workbook with 5 sheets and hyperlinked sources

**Result:** Clean, deduplicated property owner list with verified source links - ready for direct mail or analysis.
